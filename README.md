## MEBI-3000 dataset

MEBI-3000 dataset consists of 3000 images, with 2000 sourced from the Tianchi competition and the remaining 1000 were selected from relevant medical invoices datasets on the AI Studio platform. Out of the 3000 images, 2300 are used for training, while the remaining 700 are reserved for testing. These images is mainly scanned images and photos taken with mobile phones, specifically created for detecting and recognizing medical ticket text. The dataset covers various invoice types, including discharge summaries, prescription invoices, outpatient invoices, and inpatient invoices. It represents real-life scenarios encountered in medical insurance applications and encompasses challenges such as mixed text and images, camera shake, skewed images, densely populated text, and table data. Sensitive information in the images has been anonymized to ensure privacy protection. MEBI-3000 provides a practical and representative dataset for medical insurance image analysis.
